# React From Scratch

This is a project where I go through and configure a React project from scratch rather than using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This also is configured to use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

To get started, run `npm install` to install the needed dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the development server.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app to the `public` folder.
